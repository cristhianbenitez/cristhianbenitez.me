description: "This concept work embodies my artistic interpretation
of George Orwell's '1984' as a book cover. It captures the unsettling
presence of 'Big Brother's eyes, and the perpetual feeling of surveillance.
 Through thoughtful design and symbolic elements, the artwork visually represents
 the themes of the novel, evoking a sense of constant observation."
