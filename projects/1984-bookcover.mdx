description: "This concept work embodies my artistic interpretation
  of George Orwell's '1984' as a book cover. It captures the unsettling
  presence of 'Big Brother's eyes', and the perpetual feeling of surveillance.
  Through thoughtful design and symbolic elements, the artwork visually represents
  the themes of the novel, evoking a sense of constant observation."
