Are you willing to be uncomfortable for 5 minutes?. Exercising is easier once you've started the workout. Conversation is easier once you've already started to talk. Writing is easier once on the middle of it(maybe hah).
But many rewards in life will elude you if you're not willing to be a little uncomfortable first
